<p>"Works for me." The words spoken to dismiss a thousand bugs. "Can't Reproduce." Issue closed. "You're getting worked up over nothing." "It was just a joke." "I worked just as hard to get here." "It didn't bother me." Problem dismissed.</p><p>"Works for me" is a natural reaction when confronted with cultural issues that don't impact us directly. It's a statement that isn't innacurate, but is wildly incomplete. We have to learn to see past our own experiences and see and accept the experiences of others.</p><p>This talk will dive into how and why dismissal of culture concerns happens in the tech community, and how we can combat it with knowledge and empathy.</p>
